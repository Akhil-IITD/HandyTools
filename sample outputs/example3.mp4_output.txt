 Welcome to the course titled Introduction to Probability and Statistics. This is an NPTEL online course and this course has about 8 to 10 hours of content. As the title suggests this is an introductory course that is going to introduce you and prepare you for more detailed study in probability and statistics. It is more like a prerequisite course, it is more like a preterm course which prepares you for more difficult topics in probability and statistics. This course essentially covers about 10 or 12 broad topics which I will try my best to explain in about 8 hours of content, some aspects of statistics and some aspects of probability. So, we will begin with data, what is data and classification or different types of data. And then we will describe what are called categorical data and then we will go on to describe numerical data. We study ways of presenting each type of data in terms of charts, in terms of figures and so on. We then move on to study how these data is associated. So, we would study association of categorical data as well as association of numerical data which gives us opportunity to learn about measures of central tendency applicable and relevant to each type of data. We would also be studying measures such as variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, correlation and so on. Then we move on to probability, we move on to basic probability and from then we move on to conditional probability and after these two we study random variables and then we also try to study association among random variables and then we move on to probability models for counts which means we do the binomial distribution and then we also study the normal distribution. So, these are broadly the topics that will be covered in this course and as I mentioned in the beginning this is a very very introductory course and this prepares you for more detailed inferential statistics topics that can come later in either a subsequent course or you can learn them through more advanced statistics courses from NPTEL through the online mode. So, let me once again welcome you to this course and let me hope that I am able to deliver these introductory concepts to you which would help you learn a lot more probability and statistics in the future and prepare you for a more exciting journey in probability and statistics. Welcome to this course all the best and thank you very much.
