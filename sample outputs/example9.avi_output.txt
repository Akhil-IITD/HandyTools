 Each of us lives, dependent and bound by our individual knowledge and our awareness. All that is what we call reality. However, both knowledge and awareness are aquifical. One's reality might be another's illusion. We all live inside our own fantasies. Except pain. No pain. The human except pain. And no pain. Those who do not know pain will never understand true peace. Wake up to reality. Nothing ever goes as planned in the secerced world. But the longer you live the more you will realize that the only things that truly exist in this reality are merely pain, suffering and futility. Listen. Everywhere you look in this world, wherever there is light, there will always be shadows to be found as well. As long as there is a concept of victors, the vanquished will also exist. The selfish intent of wanting to preserve peace in this shit was, and he drew his born in order to protect love. There are nexus cause of relationships that cannot be separated. Rejection makes a man stronger. I believe that you can't call yourself a real man unless you can laugh off all the bad stuff that happens to you. Or at least use it as writing material. So a man's only job is to be strong? Kind of. But that isn't the entire story. Basically the pursuit of happiness isn't for us. Even if I get chopped into pieces, I'm gonna beat her with tomorrow. Those who break the rules are scum. That's true. But those who abandon their friends are worse than scum.
